# Sendgrid python emailer

## Scope
This is a simple script to run an email [base.html](./base.html) through Sendgrid.

You need to add a list of emails (internal), if you would like to send it as "jjasghar@gmail.com" not you will be tagged as EXTERNAL.

But as long as you send only "@ibm.com" emails from "jja@ibm.com" you WILL NOT be EXTERNAL.
